# Hackathon Rules

These are standard competition rules used at Hackathons.If you have a suggestion for these rules or a question about them, please email us at [azhar@skillenza.com](mailto:azhar@skillenza.com).


## The spirit of the competition

Remember that hackathons are like marathons. Some people compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is, make sure you're upholding the [hacker spirit](https://medium.com/@tfogo/the-spirit-of-hackathons-a0d81a65060a#.6cx5ac9t8).

## The rules of the competition

1. There is a maximum team size of 4 people. As a participant, you should make sure to check how many prizes are available per team. There is usually a limited number of prizes for each challenge. So if you form a large team and win a challenge, there might not be enough prizes for everyone on your team.
2. Teams should be made up exclusively of people who are not organisers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position of the program.
4. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organisers, volunteers, sponsors, and others over the common online platform.
5. All work on a project should be done during the online hackathon phase.
6. Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
7. Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s hard to find something that’s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
8. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code).
9. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
10. Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners.
11. Teams must submit their projects by 31st March, 11:55 PM IST. Any projects being submitted after the deadline will not be accepted. 
12. Projects that violate the Code of Conduct are not allowed.
13. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organisers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.
14. Being an Open Source Hackathon, each and every project developed at MishMash should be open source having appropriate License Documents to avoid any unauthorised use of the same.


## Judging Criteria

Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria according to their discretion. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

- __Innovation__ 
- __Implementation of Azure Services__ 
- __Completion:__ Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
- __Business Impact__ 

These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.

It's important to note that these judging criteria do not include:

- How good your code is. It doesn't matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn't production ready, we're not going to mark you down.
- How well you pitch. Hacking is about building and learning, not about selling.
- How good the idea is. Again, hackathons aren't about coming up with innovative ideas. It's about building and learning.
- How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you're learning and having fun, that's a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks!

So don't worry about coming up with the next big idea or building the next Google. You'll have plenty of time for that outside the hackathon. just focus on learning, having fun, and making new friends. At the end of the day the skills you learn and the friends you make might lead to the next big thing—but you don't have to do that to win a hackathon.


## Remember!

The competition is just a part of the hackathon. To make the most out of the event, try something new, teach other people, and make new friends over the Online Platform!

Happy Hacking from the Skillenza Team!
